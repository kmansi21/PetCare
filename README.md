🐾 PetCare – Pet Adoption & Management System

PetCare is a web-based pet adoption platform built with Django + MongoDB.
It helps connect people with both street-rescued pets and home-raised pets for safe and responsible adoption.

🌍 Project Purpose

PetCare provides a simple platform where:

·	Providers (Rescuers / Owners) can list Street Pets or Home Pets
