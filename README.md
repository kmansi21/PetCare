# 🐾 PetCare – Pet Adoption & Management System

PetCare is a web-based pet adoption platform built with Django and MongoDB.  
It helps connect people with both street-rescued pets and home-raised pets for safe and responsible adoption.

## 🌍 Project Purpose

Many street animals don’t get homes, and many home-raised pets need responsible adopters.  
PetCare provides a simple platform where:

- Providers (Rescuers / Owners) can list Street Pets or Home Pets  
- Adopters can view and adopt available pets  
- Providers can track adoption details  
---
## 🚀 Features

### 👤 Adopter
- Register & Login  
- View Available Pets  
- Adopt Street or Home Pets  
- Submit Adoption Details  

### 🏠 Provider / Rescuer
- Add Pet (Street / Home Category)  
- Manage Listed Pets  
- View Adopter Information 
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Backend: Django  
- Database: MongoDB  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- Authentication: Session-based  

## 🗄️ Database Collections

- `pets` → Pet details (type: street/home)

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Provider adds a pet (Street or Home).  
2. Pet appears on adoption page.  
3. User submits adoption form.  
4. Pet status updates to **Adopted**.  
5. Provider can view adopter details from dashboard.
